1- Test Code
2- Optimize Code
3- Build App for Production
4- Upload Production Code to Server
5- Configure Server

2- Lazy Loading:
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
const NewQuote = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/NewQuote'));
now wrape Suspense around the place where we are using React.lazy, so around my routes
<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>

also optimize it in different ways like using React memo

3- npm run build

4- deploy app on a static hosting provider

firebase hosting:disable
and on firebase you can select your old deployment and delete it
