let people: {
    name: string;
    age: string;
}[];

type inference:
let course = 'React'; // no need to set : string because this will be redundant since typescript will assign this by default because it is initialized as a string

type alias
type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

//functions and types
function add (a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

// Generics
// it helps typescript to pick types when we want the returned type to be recognized but we also want to make the fn flexible to accept both string and integer
function insertAtBeginning<T>(array: T[], value: T) {
  const newArray = [value, ...array];
  return newArray;
