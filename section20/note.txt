activeClassName={classes.active}

useParams to get value of params

import {Redirect} from react-router-dom
<Route path="/" exact >
    <Redirect to "welcome" />
</Route>



will a route without exact accept /welcom if we have /welcome route?
for nested routes could we not add the full path again?

blockquote html?
figcaption html?

<Route path="*" exact >
    <NotFound />
</Route>

programatic navigation:
import {useHistory} from 'react-router-dom';
const history = useHistory();
history.push('/quotes')
//do the code below this gets executed?

import {Prompt} from 'react-router-dom'

<Fragment>
<Prompt when={true} message={(location) => 'Are you sure you want to leave? All your entered data will be lost!'} />
//location object holds info about the page we're trying to go to which will allow us to include the path we're trying to go to in this message we're showing
</Fragment>

useLocation to access location information so we can get query params
history.push rerenders the component event if we stayed on the same page because history is changed
do history.replace have similar action if nothing was changed?

//to modify the queryParams string to object //note URLSearchParams is a js fn
const location = useLocation();
const queryParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search)

const isSortingAscending = queryParams.get('sort');

inside <Route></Route> you can either render a component or any jsx code

import {useRouteMatch} from "react-router-dom"

const match = useRouteMatch()
now in the nested route you can write the beginning of the path dynamically ${match.path}

history.push({
    pathname: location.pathname,
    search: ?sort='asc'
})
